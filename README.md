Vocabulary ExpandR Challenge
============================

*Expand your R vocabulary, get goodies*

Inspired by Hadley Wickham's Advanced R chapter, [Vocabulary](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html), we have a fun challenge for our WMRUG members! **We are looking for people to talk about R functions that you think should be in every R user's toolkit. Participants will get FREE CANDY or FREE COFFEE!**

An R programmer has a tendency to collect cool functions and idioms over time. When an R programmer comes across a problem that they have not encountered before, they usually have to hit the documentation, browse the blogosphere, or peruse some package vignettes. This is a great way to discover new functionality and become a more well-rounded R user.

We want to leverage each other's expertise to become more well-rounded as a group and share our knowledge with each other. Please come show us some gems in your collection or show us that you can teach an old function new tricks!

## How it works

It's easy! Just present a short 10 minute talk about a function at a West Michigan R User's Group meeting. After your presentation, you get your choice of **KING SIZE** candyba*R* or a $5 gift card to Sta*R*bucks.

## What you have to do

1. Identify a function that has been helpful to you or you think every R programmer should know.
1. Tell us what the function does.
1. Tell us why we should use it.
1. Show us its usage.
1. Show us a use-case or two where you have used it.

Email your presentation to the [West Michigan R User's Group](mailto:WestMichiganRUsersGroup@googlegroups.com) with the following information:

- Your name
- Which month you would like to present
- Which treat you would like
- Whether we can post your presentation to this GitHub repository (under GPLv3)
- (Optional) You may submit a PR to this repos if you would like.

## Tips

### Need inspiration?

- Looking back at at some of your old R code is a good place to help you get started! 
- Check out Hadley Wickham's Advanced R chapter, [Vocabulary](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html) if you need some ideas!

### Having trouble making the presentation?

- R's documentation is a great place to get started with basic information on a function
- [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html) has lots of great slide formats, such as ioslides, reveal.js, and slidy.

## "Why should I?"

- The prestige of showing off your R knowlege.
- Practice your public speaking skills.
- Engage with your fellow WMRUG members.
- If that is not enough, think of the **FREE GOODIES**!
